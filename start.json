{"About_Me": "After a successful legal career in the corporate world of New York City, I decided to return to the practice of law in its purest and most rewarding form \u2013 where a lawyer establishes a close, one-on-one working relationship with a client who requires counseling or representation in litigation or other proceedings. On a legal landscape where too often establishing a meaningful connection with the client is lost among less important considerations, my practice is founded on the belief that the personal attention of an experienced, thoughtful and committed counselor is the key element necessary for success. I chose the beautiful Hudson Valley for my practice, where the pace of life is different, but the need for quality legal representation is just as critically important.\r\nI am\u00a0the founder and principal attorney of Lawrence S. Menkes P.C., with an office in Stone\u00a0Ridge, New York, serving clients in Ulster County, as well as aurrounding areas. I am an experienced litigator and family law attorney who has been advising clients for more than 30 years. I have the knowledge and skill\u00a0necessary to achieve a favorable resolution of your case and to provide the guidance and support you need to protect your rights."},
